Hello world!
My current project is to create a basic webpage with a few recipes.
So far, I have learned about the boilerplate
html elements, attributes, lists and links.
though I am getting by rather slowly, I have taken a liking to commiting myself to do this
and trying to stay within the command line whenever possible. navigating, creating new files, opening files etc.
After having some fun with my site, I started utilizing google quite a bit to recall info about linking hrefs and gifs.
the assignment took me really really long to complete, I probably took time for granted before getting it done.
However, I had fun once I let the assignment take its own course.
At first the work load stunned me into thinking theres no way.
To me struggling to work though it, eventually it just seemed like it needed a bit more work to it having the specifications required to progress.
