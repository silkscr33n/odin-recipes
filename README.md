Hello world!
My current project is to create a basic webpage with a few recipes.
So far, I have learned about the boilerplate
html elements, attributes, lists and links.
though I am getting by rather slowly, I have taken a liking to commiting myself to do this
and trying to stay within the command line whenever possible. navigating, creating new files, opening files etc.
