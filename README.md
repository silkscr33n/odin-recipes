Hello world!
My current project is to create a basic webpage with a few recipes.
So far, I have learned about the boilerplate
html elements, attributes, lists and links.
though I am getting by rather slowly, I have taken a liking to commiting myself to do this
and trying to stay within the command line whenever possible. navigating, creating new files, opening files etc.
After having some fun with my site, I started utilizing google quite a bit to recall info about linking hrefs and gifs.
the assignment took me really really long to complete, I probably took time for granted before getting it done.
However, I had fun once I let the assignment take its own course.
At first the work load stunned me into thinking theres no way.
To me struggling to work though it, eventually it just seemed like it needed a bit more work to it having the specifications required to progress.

In this part of the assignment I've been able to learn very basic fundimentals about css.
I've learned about selectors, classes, ids. amd type selectors as well as the universal selectors.
It's an overwhelming about of informatoin to wrap my head around.
so far I've been able to include styles to my home page.
I'm working on the other pages as soon as I finish typing this.
